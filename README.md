# TV Shows and Movies Application

Trying to use scalable and modular CSS inside components (having some global styles that apply to page and additional component based styles). Using rems instead of pixels. Having animations, application being both mobile friendly and responsive

Having two services -> for API calls and a simple state keeping service using Subjects.
Trying to reduce duplication of code.

Created mocks file for stubs and mocks, wrote a couple of unit tests, to check whether they work.
(unit tests are run with the commang ng test)

## To run the app:

Run ng build, and then npm start OR check it on heroku at -> [Here](https://angular-movie-tvshow-api.herokuapp.com/shows)

NOTE: I filtered out the movies/shows without an image (to be more visually appealing).
